# NBA-Regression-Analysis-2010-2021
## This is the repository for the regression analysis I conducted in 2022 of statistical drivers of winning in the NBA between the years of 2010-2021.

In this project, I scraped data from the internet on NBA team statistics from the early 2000s up to the 2020-2021 season. I subsetted this data to the modern period of the last 10 years worth of data and conducted a range of statistical tests including basic correlation/fit tests, regression analysis + modeling, k-means clustering, cluster plots, and cross-validation techniques to determine the statistical significance of which stats in basketball best predict regular-season performance outcomes.

After having conducted data management, analysis, and visualization, conveying important concepts and outcomes to expert and non-expert interactors alike was done through a written report in the style of a scientific research paper. This included an abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, and Conclusions/Implications for the reader to draw as much insight as possible from the contents of this research project.
